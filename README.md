The repository contains the codes for visualization of few mathematical points for KCF.

A sample visualization shown in the paper is below:

- Block Cirulant Matrices (used for negative sampling of the images)

![BCCM Matrix of a sample target](images/targer_circ_shifts.png?raw=true "BCCM Marix of a sample target")

All files ending with _live.mls should be run as a [MATLAB live scripts](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/create-live-scripts.html) and the reminaing that end with _non_live.m are plain MATLAB files.
