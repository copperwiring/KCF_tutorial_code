The repository contains the codes for visualization of few mathematical points mentioned in the the paper:

### Kernel Correlation Filter: A Comprehensive Guide, Experimental Analysis, Challenges, and Benchmark Comparisons

Some of the visualizations shown in the paper are:

- Block Cirulant Matrices (used for negative sampling of the images)
